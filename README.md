**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

I worked on a reinforcement learning, where I was given existing code for a maze game environment and a Q-learning agent. I created additional code to address issues, improve training, and monitor progress.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists develop algorithms, models, and software to solve complex problems in diverse domains. Their work matters because it drives technological advancements, improves efficiency, and addresses real-world challenges.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As a computer scientist, I break down problems, identify patterns, and design algorithms or models to solve them, following a structured and analytical problem-solving approach.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

Ethically, I must consider fairness, transparency, and privacy when developing software or AI systems. Responsible training and transparent communication about limitations and biases are essential to build trust with users and stakeholders.
